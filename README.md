# Polylinguist Class: Multi-Language Computer Science Curriculum

This repository contains a computer science curriculum designed to teach programming concepts through exposure to multiple programming languages, emphasizing that Computer Science is a language-agnostic discipline.

## Repository Organization

This repository contains **two versions** of the curriculum:

### 📚 Nine-Language Version (`nine-language-version/`)

**Original comprehensive curriculum** featuring 9 languages across all major paradigms:
- **Core Languages**: Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, C, Haskell, Racket, Prolog, Rust
- **Approach**: Simultaneous exposure to all languages, building deep polyglot expertise over a full academic year
- **Target Audience**: Honors sections, advanced students, or year-long sequences
- **Status**: Complete with 16 core lessons, projects, and comprehensive instructor resources

### 🎯 Three-Language Version (`three-language-version/`) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Streamlined curriculum** with more manageable cognitive load:

**Core Languages (heavily featured throughout):**
1. **Python** - Multi-paradigm, accessible, industry-relevant
2. **C++** - Object-oriented + systems programming (aligns with AP CS and state standards)
3. **Haskell** - Pure functional programming, advanced type systems

**Minor Languages (1-2 week modules):**
- **Racket** - Lisp/Scheme, macros, language-oriented programming
- **C** - Systems programming fundamentals, memory management
- **Rust** - Modern systems programming with safety guarantees
- **Prolog** - Logic programming, declarative thinking

**Capstone Projects:** Each term includes a capstone project where students choose one of the minor languages to build something substantial.

**Target Audience:**
- Standard intro CS courses
- Students with varying backgrounds
- Quarter or semester-based courses
- Institutions using C++ as a standard

## Which Version Should I Use?

### Choose the **Three-Language Version** if:
- ✅ You're teaching a standard intro CS course
- ✅ Your students have mixed backgrounds (some beginners, some with exposure)
- ✅ You're working within quarter or semester constraints
- ✅ Your institution uses C++ as a standard language
- ✅ You want students to achieve deep proficiency in core languages

### Choose the **Nine-Language Version** if:
- ✅ You're teaching an honors or advanced section
- ✅ Students have prior programming exposure
- ✅ You have a full academic year (30 weeks)
- ✅ You have strong TA support for multiple toolchains
- ✅ You want maximum paradigm exposure

## Core Philosophy (Shared by Both Versions)

Both versions share the same fundamental pedagogical approach:

1. **Concepts Before Syntax** - Programming ideas transcend specific languages
2. **Comparative Learning** - Understanding differences between languages deepens conceptual knowledge
3. **Language Agnosticism** - No language is "the best"; all have tradeoffs
4. **Active Experimentation** - Students learn by doing, breaking, and fixing
5. **Paradigm Diversity** - Exposure to different ways of thinking about computation

## Course Design Principles

- **Transferable Skills**: Focus on concepts that apply across all languages
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Carefully scaffolded from accessible to challenging
- **Real-World Relevance**: Projects and exercises mirror professional development
- **Inclusive Pedagogy**: Multiple entry points for students with different backgrounds
- **Thoughtful Assessment**: Emphasis on understanding over syntax memorization

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your version** (three-language recommended for most contexts)
2. **Read the README** in your chosen version directory
3. **Review the Instructor Guide** for teaching strategies
4. **Set up development environments** following the setup guide
5. **Start with Lesson 1** and work through the progression

## Course Materials

Both versions include:
- **Lesson Content**: Comprehensive explanations with side-by-side code examples
- **Exercises**: Progressive difficulty from warmup to challenge problems
- **Solutions**: Reference implementations in all featured languages
- **Projects**: Integrative capstone projects building real applications
- **Instructor Resources**: Teaching guides, rubrics, pacing guides, assessment strategies
- **Setup Guides**: Step-by-step installation and configuration
- **Test Scripts**: Automated testing to verify all code examples work
