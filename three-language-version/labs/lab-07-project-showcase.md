## Part 1: Before Your Presentation (5 minutes prep)

### Checklist

Before presenting, make sure you can:
- [ ] Run your project without errors
- [ ] Explain what it does in one sentence
- [ ] Show the most interesting feature
- [ ] Discuss one challenge you overcame
- [ ] Share one thing you'd do differently

### Presentation Structure (5-7 minutes)

1. **Introduction (30 sec)**: What is your project? What problem does it solve?
2. **Demo (2-3 min)**: Show it working! Walk through the main features.
3. **Code highlight (1-2 min)**: Show one piece of code you're proud of.
4. **Challenges (1 min)**: What was hardest? How did you solve it?
5. **Reflection (30 sec)**: What would you do differently? What did you learn?

### Tips for a Great Presentation

**Do:**
- Practice beforehand (even just once!)
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Show enthusiasm for what you built
- Be honest about challenges

**Don't:**
- Apologize excessively ("This is bad, but...")
- Read code line by line
- Rush through the demo
- Ignore questions

## Part 2: Giving Feedback (During presentations)

### The Feedback Form

For each presentation, write notes on:

**Project: __________________ Presenter: __________________**

| Category | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **What worked well** | |
| **Something impressive** | |
| **One suggestion** | |
| **Question I have** | |

### Feedback Guidelines

**Be specific, not vague:**
- ❌ "It was good"
- ✅ "The way you organized the menu options made it easy to navigate"

**Be constructive, not critical:**
- ❌ "The code is messy"
- ✅ "Breaking the long function into smaller ones might make it easier to read"

**Be kind, but honest:**
- ❌ "Everything was perfect!"
- ✅ "The core functionality is solid. Adding input validation would make it even better."

### The Feedback Sandwich

Structure feedback as:
1. **Positive**: Something that worked well
2. **Constructive**: A suggestion for improvement
3. **Encouraging**: End on a positive note

## Part 3: Presentation Order

Your instructor will assign presentation order. While waiting:
- Review your project one more time
- Practice your opening sentence
- Take deep breaths!

---

## Part 4: After All Presentations (15 minutes)

### Activity 4.1: Written Peer Feedback

Choose 2-3 projects (not your own) and write detailed feedback using this template:

```
Project: [Name]
Presenter: [Name]

STRENGTHS:
- [Specific thing that worked well]
- [Another strength]

SUGGESTIONS:
- [One improvement idea]

WHAT I LEARNED:
- [Something from this project I might use in my own work]
```

### Activity 4.2: Self-Reflection

Answer these questions for yourself:

1. **What went well in my presentation?**

2. **What would I do differently next time?**

3. **What's the most useful feedback I received?**

4. **What's one thing I saw in someone else's project that I want to try?**

## Part 5: Celebration and Recognition

### Quick Awards (Fun, informal)

Vote as a class for:
- 🎨 **Most Creative**: Unique approach or unexpected feature
- 🔧 **Most Technically Impressive**: Complex implementation done well
- 📖 **Best Explained**: Clearest presentation and code walkthrough
- 💡 **Best Problem Solved**: Most useful or practical project

### Gallery Walk (If time)

Set up laptops around the room. Everyone walks around and tries each other's projects.

## Reflection Assignment

Complete the project reflection (due before next class):

### Project Reflection Template

```markdown
# Project 1 Reflection: Personal Dashboard

## What I Built
[1-2 sentences describing your project]

## What I'm Most Proud Of
[Describe a feature, piece of code, or design decision you're proud of]

## Biggest Challenge
[What was the hardest part? How did you overcome it?]

## What I Learned
[New concepts, techniques, or skills you developed]

## What I'd Do Differently
[If you started over, what would you change?]

## Feedback Received
[Summarize the most useful feedback you received]

## Goals for Project 2
[Based on this experience, what will you focus on next time?]
```

## For Next Time

After the showcase:

1. **Incorporate feedback**: Choose one piece of feedback to implement (optional extra credit)
2. **Start thinking about Project 2**: Data Explorer - what data interests you?
3. **Begin OOP concepts**: We'll be designing with classes next week

## Instructor Notes

### Timing Tips

- Keep presentations to time (use a visible timer)
- Allow 1-2 questions per presentation if time permits
- Have a backup plan for technical difficulties

### Creating Safe Space

- Model positive feedback yourself
- Celebrate effort, not just results
- Acknowledge that presenting is hard

### Handling Issues

- Student's project doesn't work? Let them explain what it was supposed to do
- Student is too nervous? Offer to present alongside them
- Running short on time? Skip Q&A, do written feedback only
