## Part 1: Presentation Guidelines

### Presentation Format (8-10 minutes)

1. **Introduction** (1-2 min)
   - What did you build?
   - What inspired your choice?

2. **Live Demo** (3-4 min)
   - Show the key features
   - Walk through a typical user experience
   - Show at least 2 different paths/outcomes

3. **Technical Deep Dive** (2-3 min)
   - Architecture/design decisions
   - Interesting code snippet
   - How you used OOP or functional concepts

4. **Challenges & Learning** (1-2 min)
   - What was hardest?
   - What would you do differently?
   - What are you most proud of?

### Tips for Great Presentations

**Do:**
- Practice your demo path beforehand
- Have backup screenshots in case of technical issues
- Show enthusiasm for your creative choices
- Explain your code at a high level (don't read line by line)

**Don't:**
- Apologize for your work
- Speed through the demo
- Skip the technical discussion
- Go over time

## Part 2: Project 3 - Interactive Story Game

If presenting an Interactive Story Game:

### Key Points to Cover

- **Narrative structure**: How did you design the branching?
- **State management**: How do player choices affect the story?
- **Multiple endings**: Show at least 2 different endings
- **Creative elements**: What makes your story unique?

### Demo Suggestions

1. Show the opening and first choice
2. Play through to one ending
3. Show a different path to a different ending
4. Highlight an interesting decision point

### Technical Highlights

- How did you structure story data?
- Did you use classes for characters/locations?
- How do you track player inventory/stats?
- Any pattern matching or state machines?

## Part 3: Project 4 - Simulation

If presenting a Simulation:

### Key Points to Cover

- **What are you simulating?**: Ecosystem, physics, social dynamics?
- **Agent design**: How do entities behave?
- **Emergent behavior**: What unexpected patterns appeared?
- **Parameters**: What can users control?

### Demo Suggestions

1. Show initial state
2. Run simulation with default parameters
3. Show how changing parameters affects outcome
4. Highlight an interesting emergent behavior

### Technical Highlights

- How did you model agents?
- What update loop did you use?
- How do agents interact?
- Data collection and analysis methods?
