## Part 1: Project 2 Presentations

### Presentation Format (7-10 minutes each)

1. **Introduction** (1 min)
   - What data did you explore?
   - Why did you choose it?

2. **Demo** (3-4 min)
   - Show the data loading
   - Demonstrate analysis features
   - Show visualizations or summaries

3. **Technical Highlight** (2-3 min)
   - One piece of code you're proud of
   - How you handled a challenge

4. **What You Learned** (1-2 min)
   - Technical skills gained
   - What would you do differently?

### Presentation Tips

- **Start with the "why"** - Why does this data matter?
- **Show, don't tell** - Run your code live
- **Embrace errors** - If something breaks, explain what you'd fix
- **Be proud** - You built this!

## Part 2: Peer Feedback

### Feedback Form

For each presentation, note:

| Category | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Data choice** | Was it interesting/relevant? |
| **Analysis quality** | Did they find meaningful insights? |
| **Code highlight** | What impressed you technically? |
| **Presentation** | Clear? Engaging? |
| **One suggestion** | Constructive improvement |

### Recognition Categories

Vote for:
- 📊 **Best Data Story** - Most compelling narrative from data
- 💻 **Most Technical** - Impressive code or algorithms
- 🎨 **Best Visualization** - Clearest or most creative display
- 🔍 **Best Insight** - Found something surprising in the data
- 📈 **Most Improved** - Biggest growth from Project 1

## Part 3: Quarter 1 Reflection

### Individual Reflection (10 minutes)

Answer these questions honestly:

**Technical Growth:**
1. What programming concepts were completely new to you this quarter?
2. Which language do you feel most comfortable with? Least?
3. What was the hardest thing you learned? How did you overcome it?

**Process Growth:**
1. How has your approach to problem-solving changed?
2. What debugging strategies do you use now that you didn't before?
3. How do you handle getting stuck?

**Looking Ahead:**
1. What do you want to improve in Quarter 2?
2. What topic are you most excited to learn next?
3. What kind of project would you love to build?

### Pair Discussion (5 minutes)

Share one answer from each section with a partner.
