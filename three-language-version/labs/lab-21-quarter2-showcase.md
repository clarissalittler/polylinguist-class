## Part 1: Project Presentations

### Project 5: Language Tool

Present your language processing tool! This project showcased your ability to work with text and apply multiple paradigms.

### Presentation Format (8-10 minutes)

1. **What does it do?** (1-2 min)
   - What language task does it solve?
   - Who would use this tool?

2. **Live Demo** (3-4 min)
   - Show the tool in action
   - Demonstrate edge cases
   - Show how it handles errors

3. **Technical Highlights** (2-3 min)
   - What paradigm(s) did you use?
   - Show a piece of code you're proud of
   - What design patterns did you apply?

4. **Lessons Learned** (1-2 min)
   - What was the hardest part?
   - What would you do differently?
   - What are you most proud of?

### Types of Language Tools

Common project types to discuss:
- **Translator/Converter** (format to format)
- **Analyzer** (extract information from text)
- **Generator** (create text from templates)
- **Parser** (interpret structured text)
- **Formatter** (clean up/beautify code or text)
