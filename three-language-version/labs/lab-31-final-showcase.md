## Final Words

### From Your Instructor

[Space for instructor message]

### Remember

> "The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it."
> — Dennis Ritchie

> "Programming is not about what you know; it's about what you can figure out."
> — Chris Pine

> "The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly."
> — Donald Knuth

### You Did It!

From "Hello World" to capstone projects, you've:
- Written thousands of lines of code
- Learned multiple languages
- Mastered different paradigms
- Built real projects
- Overcome countless bugs
- Grown as problem solvers

**This is just the beginning.**

The world needs people who can think computationally, solve problems creatively, and build things that matter. You now have the foundation to do all of that.

**Go build something amazing.**
