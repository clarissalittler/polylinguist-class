# Lab 30: Capstone Work Time

**Quarter 3, Week 10**
**Duration:** Full class period
**Format:** Independent work with support

## Overview

This is dedicated work time for your capstone project. Use this time wisely to make significant progress with instructor support available.

## Today's Goals

By the end of this lab, you should have:
- [ ] Core functionality working
- [ ] At least one test written
- [ ] Progress documented
- [ ] Plan for remaining work

---

## Part 1: Check-In (10 minutes)

### Quick Status Update

Share with a neighbor or instructor:

1. **What's working?**
   _________________________________

2. **What's blocking you?**
   _________________________________

3. **What's your focus for today?**
   _________________________________

### Priority Setting

List your tasks in order of importance:

| Priority | Task | Est. Time | Status |
|----------|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
| 4 | | | |
| 5 | | | |

---

## Part 2: Focused Work (60 minutes)

### Work Blocks

Try working in focused 25-minute blocks (Pomodoro technique):

**Block 1 (25 min):** Focus on highest priority task
- Start time: _____
- Task: _________________________________
- Completed: [ ]

**5 minute break**

**Block 2 (25 min):** Next priority
- Start time: _____
- Task: _________________________________
- Completed: [ ]

**5 minute break**

### Getting Unstuck

If you're stuck, try:

1. **Rubber duck debugging** - Explain the problem out loud
2. **Simplify** - Can you solve a simpler version?
3. **Search** - Check documentation, Stack Overflow
4. **Ask** - Instructor, classmate, or online community
5. **Take a break** - Sometimes stepping away helps

### Common Issues Checklist

- [ ] Import/module errors - Check file paths and names
- [ ] Type errors - Print values to check types
- [ ] Logic errors - Add print statements to trace execution
- [ ] Off-by-one errors - Check loop bounds carefully
- [ ] Null/None errors - Check for empty cases

---

## Part 3: Testing Your Code (10 minutes)

### Write At Least One Test

Even a simple test is better than none:

```python
# Python example
def test_basic_functionality():
    result = your_function(input)
    assert result == expected_output

# Run with: pytest test_file.py
```

```rust
// Rust example
#[test]
fn test_basic() {
    assert_eq!(your_function(input), expected);
}

// Run with: cargo test
```

### Test Ideas for Common Projects

**Game:** Test that commands work correctly
**Tool:** Test with known input/output pairs
**Parser:** Test valid and invalid inputs
**Data project:** Test calculations on sample data

---

## Part 4: Documentation Check (5 minutes)

### README Update

Does your README have:

- [ ] Project title and description
- [ ] How to install/setup
- [ ] How to run
- [ ] Example usage
- [ ] Current status/features

### Code Comments

Have you documented:

- [ ] Complex functions
- [ ] Non-obvious logic
- [ ] Important decisions

## Motivation

You've come so far this year!

Think back to Quarter 1 when "Hello World" was new. Now you're:
- Working across multiple languages
- Using advanced data structures
- Applying different paradigms
- Building something uniquely yours

**Keep going—the finish line is close!**
