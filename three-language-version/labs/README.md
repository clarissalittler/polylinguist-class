# Lab Exercises

Labs are **guided, in-class activities** designed to be completed during lab sessions with instructor support. They differ from homework exercises in that they:

- Are more structured with step-by-step guidance
- Often involve pair programming
- Focus on exploration and experimentation
- Include built-in checkpoints for instructor verification
- Encourage asking questions and collaboration

## Lab Format

Each lab includes:
- **Duration**: Expected time to complete
- **Setup**: What students need before starting
- **Objectives**: What students will learn
- **Activities**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Checkpoints**: Points where instructor can verify progress
- **Extensions**: For students who finish early
