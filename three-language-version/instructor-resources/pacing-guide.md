```

### Lab Days (2 hours)

```
0:00 - 0:15  Warm-up exercise (review)
0:15 - 0:30  Mini-lecture or demo

- Pair struggling students with stronger ones
- Offer additional office hours

### If Students Are Excelling
- Add challenge exercises
- Early introduction to minor languages
- Encourage multi-language project submissions
- Student-led review sessions
- Deeper algorithm analysis

### If Class Size Is Large
- Use TAs for lab sections
- Peer code review
- Group projects for some assignments
- Recorded lectures for review

### If Class Size Is Small
- More discussion-based learning
- Individual attention to language preferences
- Flexible project topics
- Socratic method teaching

### Lost a Week (Weather, etc.)
- Combine next two lessons
- Make one project optional
- Move content to homework with video supplement

### Material Taking Longer Than Expected
- Cut advanced exercises
- Reduce minor language time
- Make some standard requirements optional

### Students Need More Practice
