# Pacing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides detailed pacing recommendations for delivering the Three-Language Computer Science Curriculum across three 11-week quarters with project-based assessment.

**Format:** 3 quarters × 11 weeks each (33 weeks total)
**Assessment:** 100% project-based (no exams)
**Projects:** 9 major projects + capstone

## Adjusting for Your Students

### If Students Are Struggling

- Slow down early weeks (add a week to Q1 foundations)
- More Python focus early (60% Python for weeks 1-3)
- Reduce Haskell requirements temporarily
- Pair struggling students with stronger ones
- Offer additional office hours
- Simplify project requirements (focus on base, not extensions)

### If Students Are Excelling

- Add challenge exercises
- Early introduction to minor languages
- Encourage multi-language project implementations
- Have them present or tutor peers
- Deeper capstone expectations
- Encourage proposing their own creative extensions

### If Class Size Is Large (30+)

- Use TAs for lab sections
- Peer code review groups
- Split showcase over multiple sessions
- Online submissions for project reflections
- Small group discussions instead of full class

### If Class Size Is Small (<10)

- More discussion-based learning
- Individual attention to interests
- Flexible project topics
- Socratic method teaching
- Deeper individual feedback

---

## Emergency Adjustments

### Lost a Week (Weather, Illness, etc.)

- Combine adjacent lessons if conceptually similar
- Move content to homework with video supplement
- Extend project deadline by one week
- Cut minor language time if in Q2/Q3

### Material Taking Longer Than Expected

- Cut advanced exercises (keep core)
- Reduce minor language depth
- Make creative extensions optional
- Focus on fewer languages for struggling concept

### Students Need More Practice

- Add "catch-up" lab day
- Extend project deadline
- Provide additional exercises
- Peer tutoring sessions

---

## Key Rhythm

Every 3-4 weeks:
1. **Learn** new concepts through lessons
2. **Practice** through exercises and labs
3. **Apply** through creative projects
4. **Present** work and receive feedback
5. **Reflect** on what you learned

This rhythm keeps students engaged, provides regular feedback, and builds toward mastery through iteration.

---

## Success Metrics

By end of each quarter, students should:

**Q1:** Write basic programs in all three languages, explain core concepts language-agnostically, use version control

**Q2:** Compare paradigms thoughtfully, read code in 5 languages, apply pattern matching and HOF

**Q3:** Analyze algorithm efficiency, implement data structures, complete substantial independent project

---

**The goal: Students who can learn any language because they understand programming itself.**
