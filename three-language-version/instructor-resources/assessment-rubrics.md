# Assessment Rubrics

This document provides detailed rubrics for all course assessments. This is a **100% project-based course** with no traditional exams.

---

## Assessment Philosophy

### Projects Over Exams

We assess learning through creative projects, not timed tests. Here's why:

- **Exams measure recall; projects measure understanding.** Building something demonstrates deeper learning than answering questions under time pressure.
- **Programming is creative work.** Students learn best when they care about what they're building and can make it their own.
- **Real-world alignment.** Professional success depends on building things, not taking tests.

### The Five Dimensions

Every project is assessed on five dimensions that reflect what matters in real programming:

| Dimension | Weight | What We're Looking For |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Creativity & Ambition** | 25% | Did they push themselves? Try something interesting? |
| **Functionality** | 25% | Does it work? Does it do what they intended? |
| **Code Quality** | 20% | Is it readable, organized, well-structured? |
| **Process & Iteration** | 15% | Version control? Iteration? Improvement over time? |
| **Reflection** | 15% | Can they articulate what they learned? |

### Concepts Over Syntax

- Partial credit for demonstrating understanding even if code doesn't compile
- Accept multiple correct approaches
- Focus on "Did they understand the concept?" not "Did they get the syntax perfect?"

---

## Grade Distribution

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| **Projects** | 75% |
| **Exercises & Labs** | 15% |
| **Participation & Reflection** | 10% |

### Project Breakdown (75% total)

| Quarter | Projects | Points Each | Total |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Q1 | Projects 1-3 | 7.5% | 22.5% |
| Q2 | Projects 4-6 | 7.5% | 22.5% |
| Q3 | Projects 7-8 + Capstone | 7.5% + 15% | 30% |

The capstone project is weighted double because it represents the culmination of the course.

## Project Rubric: The Core Framework

### Creativity & Ambition (25 points)

This is what makes projects special. We want students to make projects *their own*.

| Score | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **23-25** | Exceptional | Proposed and implemented own extensions; took creative risks; personalized deeply; shows genuine enthusiasm |
| **20-22** | Strong | Implemented multiple listed extensions; added personal touches; went beyond base requirements |
| **17-19** | Good | Implemented at least one extension; some personalization; met requirements creatively |
| **14-16** | Adequate | Met base requirements; followed spec literally; minimal personalization |
| **10-13** | Minimal | Barely met requirements; no creative effort; generic |
| **0-9** | Insufficient | Incomplete; no evident effort toward creativity |

**Key Principle:** Never penalize failed experiments. A student who tried something ambitious and partially failed shows more growth than one who played it safe.

**Signs of High Creativity:**
- Made the project about something they genuinely care about
- Tried something that might not work (and learned from it)
- Combined ideas in unexpected ways
- Asked "what if?" and explored
- Shows visible excitement when presenting

**Signs of Low Creativity (still acceptable but lower score):**
- Followed the spec word-for-word
- Chose the easiest path at every decision
- Project is generic (no personal meaning)
- No extensions attempted

---

### Functionality (25 points)

Does it work? Does it do what they set out to do?

| Score | Description | Criteria |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **23-25** | Excellent | All features work correctly; handles edge cases; robust; no crashes |
| **20-22** | Strong | Core features work; minor bugs don't break functionality; handles most inputs |
| **17-19** | Good | Main functionality works; some bugs; basic error handling |
| **14-16** | Adequate | Basic features work but incomplete; crashes on edge cases |
| **10-13** | Partial | Some parts work; significant bugs; limited functionality |
| **0-9** | Non-functional | Doesn't run or completely broken |

**Partial Credit Guidelines:**
- Code compiles/runs but wrong output: 50-70%
- Correct algorithm, implementation bugs: 60-80%
- Works for simple cases, fails on complex: 70-85%
- Core feature works, extensions broken: depends on base requirements

---

### Code Quality (20 points)

Is it readable, organized, and well-structured?

| Score | Description | Criteria |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **18-20** | Excellent | Clear organization; good naming; appropriate abstractions; easy to follow |
| **15-17** | Strong | Well-organized; mostly clear; could be cleaner but solid |
| **12-14** | Good | Adequate organization; some confusing parts; works but messy |
| **9-11** | Adequate | Disorganized; poor naming; hard to follow; but it works |
| **5-8** | Weak | Very messy; no clear structure; difficult to understand |
| **0-4** | Poor | Unreadable; no organization |

**What We Look For:**
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Appropriate use of functions (not everything in main)
- Consistent formatting
- Logical organization
- Appropriate comments (explain *why*, not *what*)

**What We DON'T Penalize:**
- Different coding styles (as long as consistent)
- Missing comments on obvious code
- Not following any specific style guide

---

### Process & Iteration (15 points)

Did they use good development practices?

| Score | Description | Criteria |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **14-15** | Excellent | Regular commits with clear messages; evidence of iteration; good workflow |
| **12-13** | Strong | Adequate commits; some iteration visible; used version control properly |
| **10-11** | Good | Used version control; could have committed more often; some iteration |
| **7-9** | Adequate | Minimal commits; "final" submission style; little iteration visible |
| **4-6** | Weak | Very few commits; no clear process |
| **0-3** | Missing | No version control or single commit |

**What We Look For:**
- Regular commits (not just one "final" commit)
- Commit messages that explain what changed
- Evidence of trying, testing, revising
- Thoughtful approach to development

---

### Reflection (15 points)

Can they articulate what they learned?

Each project requires a REFLECTION.md file answering:
1. What was the most challenging part? How did you overcome it?
2. What would you do differently if you started over?
3. What did you learn that surprised you?
4. Which language(s) did you use and why?

| Score | Description | Criteria |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **14-15** | Excellent | Thoughtful, specific answers; shows genuine learning; honest about struggles |
| **12-13** | Strong | Good answers with some depth; reflects meaningfully |
| **10-11** | Good | Adequate answers; surface-level reflection |
| **7-9** | Adequate | Brief answers; minimal thought |
| **4-6** | Weak | One-word answers; no real reflection |
| **0-3** | Missing | Not submitted or content-free |

**Signs of Good Reflection:**
- Specific examples, not vague generalities
- Honest about what didn't work
- Shows learning happened (even from failures)
- Connects to course concepts

## Late Work Policy

### Project Extensions

We prefer great work over rushed work.

- **Before deadline:** Extensions freely granted if requested
- **Incomplete at showcase:** Present what you have with a plan for completion
- **Late without extension:** -10% per day, maximum 5 days
- **Never submitted:** Zero, but offer chance to resubmit for partial credit (up to 50%)

### Exercise Extensions

- Due at end of each week
- One free "drop" per quarter (lowest exercise grade dropped)
- Late exercises accepted for partial credit (50%) until end of quarter

---

## Academic Integrity

### Collaboration Guidelines

**Encouraged:**
- Discussing concepts and approaches
- Helping debug (pointing out issues, not fixing)
- Study groups
- Sharing resources and documentation
- Peer code review (after submission)

**Not Allowed:**
- Copying code from others
- Sharing solutions before deadline
- Using AI to generate solutions without understanding
- Submitting work done by others

### AI Tools Policy

AI assistants (like ChatGPT, Copilot) are **allowed** with conditions:
1. You must understand every line of code you submit
2. You must be able to explain it if asked
3. You must cite when AI helped significantly
4. The creative vision must be yours

If you use AI and can't explain the code, that's academic dishonesty.

### Violation Consequences

| Offense | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| First | Zero on assignment, warning, educational conversation |
| Second | Failing grade in course |
| Any | Reported to academic integrity office |

### Language Preference

Students may request to be assessed primarily in one core language while still demonstrating awareness of all three.

---

## Instructor Rubric Usage Tips

### Before Grading

1. **Calibrate:** If you have TAs, grade the same submission independently, then compare
2. **Set expectations:** Know what "meets base requirements" looks like
3. **Read reflections first:** Understanding their journey helps assess fairly

### While Grading

1. **Use the rubric:** Fill out each dimension for every project
2. **Be consistent:** Same standards for everyone
3. **Provide feedback:** Points alone don't help learning
4. **Look for understanding:** Syntax errors matter less than conceptual errors
5. **Reward risk-taking:** Ambitious failures > safe successes

### After Grading

1. **Recognize improvement:** Note when students address previous feedback
2. **Look for patterns:** If many students struggled, consider teaching adjustment
3. **Celebrate creativity:** Highlight interesting approaches to the class

---

## Sample Feedback Comments

### Positive

- "I love how you made this personal—the integration of [topic] shows real creativity!"
- "Excellent risk-taking here. Even though [feature] didn't fully work, attempting it shows growth."
- "Your reflection demonstrates real learning—great insight about [concept]."
- "Beautiful code organization. This is professional quality."

### Constructive

- "The base functionality works well. Consider adding [extension] to push this further."
- "Good code, but your commit history shows this was all done in one day. Try iterating more next time."
- "Your reflection is brief—dig deeper into *why* things were challenging."
- "Consider extracting this repeated code into a function."

### Concerning

- "This code is very similar to [other submission/online source]. Please see me."
- "Your reflection doesn't match the code—can you explain [specific part]?"
- "Missing several base requirements. Please reach out to discuss."
- "No version control history makes it hard to assess your process."

---

## Final Thoughts

This rubric is designed to:
1. **Encourage creativity** — The highest grades require creative effort
2. **Value learning** — Reflection matters as much as functionality
3. **Recognize process** — How you build matters, not just what you build
4. **Be fair** — Clear expectations, consistent application

The goal is students who can build things they're proud of, reflect on their learning, and continue growing after the course ends.

---

**Remember: We're assessing growth, not perfection.**
