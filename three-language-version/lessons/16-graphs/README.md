# Lesson 16: Graphs and Graph Algorithms

## Overview

Graphs model relationships between entities.

## Graph Representations

**Adjacency List:**
```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['B', 'F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}
```

**Adjacency Matrix:**
```python
# For n nodes, create n x n matrix
# matrix[i][j] = 1 if edge exists, 0 otherwise
matrix = [
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 0]
]
```

## Graph Traversals

**Depth-First Search (DFS):**
```python
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    print(start)
    
    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
    
    return visited
```

**Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set([start])
    queue = deque([start])
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print(node)
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return visited
```

**Haskell:**
```haskell
type Graph a = [(a, [a])]

dfs :: Eq a => Graph a -> a -> [a] -> [a]
dfs graph node visited
    | node `elem` visited = visited
    | otherwise = foldl (dfs graph) (node : visited) neighbors
  where
    neighbors = case lookup node graph of
        Just ns -> ns
        Nothing -> []
```

## Classic Algorithms

**Dijkstra's Shortest Path:**
```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]
    
    while pq:
        current_dist, current = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if current_dist > distances[current]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current]:
            distance = current_dist + weight
            
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances
```

**Topological Sort:**
```python
def topological_sort(graph):
    in_degree = {node: 0 for node in graph}
    for node in graph:
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] += 1
    
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    result = []
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        result.append(node)
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return result if len(result) == len(graph) else None
```

## Applications

- Social networks
- Maps and navigation
- Web crawling
- Dependency resolution
- Network routing

## Complexity

| Algorithm | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| DFS | O(V + E) | O(V) |
| BFS | O(V + E) | O(V) |
| Dijkstra | O((V + E) log V) | O(V) |
| Topological Sort | O(V + E) | O(V) |
