## Appendix: Flexibility Notes

This pacing guide is a recommendation, not a mandate. Adjust based on:

- **Student pace**: If students need more time on fundamentals, spend it
- **Energy levels**: If a topic sparks enthusiasm, dive deeper
- **Technical issues**: Build in buffer time for setup problems
- **Guest speakers**: Adjust schedule for special opportunities

**Golden rule**: Understanding matters more than coverage.
