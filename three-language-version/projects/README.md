# Projects

This directory contains 9 creative projects plus a capstone, designed to let you build things you care about while learning programming concepts across multiple languages and paradigms.

## Philosophy: Build Things You're Proud Of

These aren't traditional assignments with rigid specifications. Each project has:
- **Base requirements** that define the minimum scope
- **Creative extensions** that push you further
- **Room for personalization** to make it yours

**The highest grades go to students who take creative risks**, not those who play it safe. A partially-working ambitious project shows more growth than a perfect but boring one.

## Project Overview by Quarter

### Quarter 1: Foundations
*Focus: Core language skills, basic data structures, creative expression*

| # | Project | Theme | Key Skills |
|---|---------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Personal Dashboard | Make something useful for YOU | Variables, I/O, control flow |
| 2 | Data Explorer | Find insights in data | Data structures, file I/O, functions |
| 3 | Interactive Story/Game | Create an experience | State management, recursion, design |

### Quarter 2: Paradigms
*Focus: OOP, functional programming, multiple paradigms*

| # | Project | Theme | Key Skills |
|---|---------|-------|------------|
| 4 | Simulation | Model a world | OOP, state over time, design patterns |
| 5 | Language Tool | Work with text | String processing, pattern matching, parsing |
| 6 | Creative Tool | Enable creativity | Full application design, user experience |

### Quarter 3: Applications
*Focus: Algorithms, data structures, integration*

| # | Project | Theme | Key Skills |
|---|---------|-------|------------|
| 7 | Efficient System | Make it fast | Algorithm analysis, optimization |
| 8 | Data Structure App | Showcase a structure | Trees, graphs, ADT implementation |
| 9 | **Capstone** | Your vision | Everything you've learned |

## Assessment: The Five Dimensions

Every project is graded on:

| Dimension | Weight | What We're Looking For |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Creativity & Ambition** | 25% | Did you push yourself? Make it personal? |
| **Functionality** | 25% | Does it work? |
| **Code Quality** | 20% | Is it readable and well-organized? |
| **Process & Iteration** | 15% | Regular commits? Evidence of iteration? |
| **Reflection** | 15% | Can you articulate what you learned? |

### The Base + Extensions Model

- **Base requirement** = B-level work
- **Base + listed extensions** = A-level work
- **Base + your OWN creative ideas** = A+ potential

We want to see what YOU think would make the project better, not just what we listed.

## Project Structure

Each project directory contains:
```
project-name/
├── README.md          # Full specification
├── REFLECTION.md      # Template for your reflection (copy and fill in)
├── starter/           # Optional starter code (if provided)
└── samples/           # Sample data or examples (if applicable)
```

## Submission Requirements

Every project submission needs:

1. **Working code** in your chosen language(s)
2. **README or comments** explaining how to run it
3. **REFLECTION.md** answering the reflection questions
4. **Git history** showing your development process
5. **Presentation** at the showcase (5-7 minutes)

---

## Language Choice

You can implement projects in any of the core languages (Python, C++, Haskell). Consider:

| If you want to... | Consider... |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Get it working quickly | Python |
| Practice OOP deeply | C++ or Python |
| Think functionally | Haskell |
| Challenge yourself | Your weakest language |
| Show off | Multiple languages |

**Bonus opportunity**: Implementing in multiple languages or a minor language (Racket, C, Rust, Prolog) can earn extra credit and deeper learning.

## Tips for Success

### Start Early
Projects take longer than you think. Start the day it's assigned.

### Make It Personal
The more you care about what you're building, the better it will be.

### Iterate
Your first version won't be your best. Build, test, improve, repeat.

### Ask for Help
Stuck? Ask early. We'd rather help you succeed than watch you struggle in silence.

### Document As You Go
Don't leave reflection until the last minute. Keep notes on what you learn.

### Take Risks
Try something that might not work. You'll learn more from ambitious failures than safe successes.

## Archive

The `archive/` folder contains alternative project specifications from earlier versions of the course. These can be used as:
- Additional practice problems
- Alternative projects (with instructor approval)
- Examples of more structured specifications
