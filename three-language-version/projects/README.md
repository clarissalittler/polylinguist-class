# Projects

This directory contains 6 progressive projects designed to apply and reinforce the concepts learned throughout the course. Projects increase in difficulty and scope, culminating in capstone-level challenges.

## Project Overview

| # | Project | Difficulty | Time | Skills | Week |
|---|---------|------------|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Text Statistics Tool | Easy-Medium | 3-5 hrs | File I/O, strings, data structures | 2-3 |
| 2 | Number Guessing Game | Easy-Medium | 2-4 hrs | Control flow, I/O, random numbers | 4-5 |
| 3 | Todo List Manager | Medium | 5-8 hrs | Data structures, file persistence | 7-8 |
| 4 | Expression Evaluator | Medium-Hard | 6-10 hrs | Parsing, recursion, trees | 9-10 |
| 5 | Polyglot Build Tool | Hard | 8-12 hrs | Process execution, file systems | 12-13 |
| 6 | Mini Programming Language | Very Hard | 15-20 hrs | Lexing, parsing, interpretation | 14-15 |

## Project Philosophy

### Multi-Language Approach

Each project can be implemented in any of the three core languages (Python, C++, Haskell). Students are encouraged to:

1. **Start with their strongest language** - Build confidence and understanding
2. **Try a second language** - Deepen learning through comparison
3. **Reflect on differences** - What was easier/harder in each language?

### Capstone Options

Projects 3-6 can serve as **capstone projects** when implemented in a minor language (Racket, C, Rust, or Prolog). Capstones require:
- Implementation in a minor language
- Written reflection on paradigm differences
- Comparison with core language approaches

### Assessment Criteria

All projects are assessed on:
- **Correctness (40%)** - Does it work as specified?
- **Design (25%)** - Is the code well-organized?
- **Documentation (15%)** - Are functions/decisions explained?
- **Testing (10%)** - Are edge cases handled?
- **Process (10%)** - Was version control used properly?

## Getting Started

Each project directory contains:
- `README.md` - Full specification and requirements
- `STARTER.md` - Hints and starting points (optional)
- Example input/output files (where applicable)

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a git branch for your project: `git checkout -b project-N-yourname`
2. Implement the project in your chosen language(s)
3. Include a `REFLECTION.md` answering the reflection questions
4. Commit regularly with meaningful messages
5. Submit via pull request or as directed by instructor

## Language Recommendations

| Project | Recommended Language | Why |
|---------|---------------------|-----|
| Text Stats | Python | Excellent string handling |
| Number Game | Any | All work well |
| Todo List | Python or Haskell | File handling differences interesting |
| Expression Eval | Haskell | Parser combinators shine |
| Build Tool | Python | Process handling easiest |
| Mini Language | Any | Deep learning in any language |

These are recommendations, not requirements. Choose based on learning goals.
