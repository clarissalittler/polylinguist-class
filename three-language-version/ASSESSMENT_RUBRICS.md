# Assessment Rubrics
## CS 101-103: Introduction to Computer Science

This document provides detailed rubrics for all assessed work in the course. Use these rubrics to understand expectations and to self-assess your work before submission.

---

## Assessment Overview

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Projects | 75% | 9 creative projects + capstone |
| Exercises & Labs | 15% | Weekly practice and in-class activities |
| Participation & Reflection | 10% | Engagement and metacognitive reflection |

---

## Project Rubric (Used for All 9 Projects)

Projects are assessed on five criteria. Each criterion is scored 0-4, then weighted according to the percentages below.

### Scoring Scale

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 4 | Exceptional | Exceeds expectations; demonstrates mastery and creativity |
| 3 | Proficient | Meets all expectations; solid, competent work |
| 2 | Developing | Meets most expectations; some gaps or issues |
| 1 | Beginning | Meets few expectations; significant gaps |
| 0 | Not Attempted | Missing or not submitted |

---

### Criterion 1: Creativity & Ambition (25%)

*Did you push yourself? Try something interesting? Make it your own?*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **4 - Exceptional** | Project demonstrates genuine creative vision. Student attempted ambitious extensions beyond requirements. Work shows personal investment and originality. Could inspire other students. |
| **3 - Proficient** | Project includes thoughtful creative choices. At least one meaningful extension implemented. Shows engagement beyond minimum requirements. |
| **2 - Developing** | Project meets base requirements with minimal personalization. Some attempt at extension but incomplete or superficial. |
| **1 - Beginning** | Project is bare-minimum implementation. No evidence of creative investment or extension attempts. |
| **0 - Not Attempted** | Project not submitted or doesn't function at all. |

**Examples of Creativity:**
- Personal Dashboard: Custom data sources, unique visualizations, unexpected features
- Interactive Story: Branching narrative complexity, multimedia integration, emotional depth
- Capstone: Ambitious scope, novel combination of concepts, professional polish

---

### Criterion 2: Functionality (25%)

*Does it work? Does it do what you set out to do?*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **4 - Exceptional** | All features work correctly and handle edge cases gracefully. No crashes or bugs discovered during testing. Robust error handling. |
| **3 - Proficient** | Core functionality works correctly. Minor bugs may exist but don't affect main use cases. Handles common inputs properly. |
| **2 - Developing** | Most features work but with noticeable bugs or limitations. Some edge cases cause problems. Core concept is demonstrated. |
| **1 - Beginning** | Basic concept is present but significant functionality is broken. Multiple bugs affect normal use. |
| **0 - Not Attempted** | Program doesn't run or produces no meaningful output. |

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Program runs without crashing
- [ ] Main features work as described
- [ ] Reasonable inputs produce expected outputs
- [ ] Error cases are handled (not just crash)
- [ ] Edge cases considered (empty input, large numbers, etc.)

---

### Criterion 3: Code Quality (20%)

*Is it readable, organized, well-structured?*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **4 - Exceptional** | Code is exemplary. Clear naming, logical organization, appropriate abstractions. Comments explain "why" not just "what." Another programmer could easily understand and modify it. |
| **3 - Proficient** | Code is well-organized and readable. Consistent style, meaningful names, reasonable structure. Some comments present. |
| **2 - Developing** | Code works but could be cleaner. Inconsistent style, some unclear names, limited organization. Few or unhelpful comments. |
| **1 - Beginning** | Code is difficult to read. Poor naming, no organization, no comments. Works but hard to understand or modify. |
| **0 - Not Attempted** | Code not submitted or entirely incomprehensible. |

**Code Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Variables and functions have descriptive names
- [ ] Code is properly indented and formatted
- [ ] Related code is grouped into functions/classes
- [ ] No unnecessary code duplication
- [ ] Comments explain complex logic
- [ ] No dead code or debugging print statements left in

---

### Criterion 4: Process & Iteration (15%)

*Did you use version control? Iterate and improve?*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **4 - Exceptional** | Excellent use of git with meaningful commits throughout development. Clear evidence of iterative improvement. Commit history tells the story of the project's evolution. |
| **3 - Proficient** | Regular git commits with reasonable messages. Evidence of iteration (not just one final commit). Process is visible. |
| **2 - Developing** | Some git usage but sporadic. Few commits or all commits at the end. Limited evidence of iteration. |
| **1 - Beginning** | Minimal or no git usage. Single commit or commits don't reflect development process. |
| **0 - Not Attempted** | No version control used or repository not shared. |

**Good Commit Practices:**
- Commit early and often (at least daily when working)
- Write meaningful commit messages ("Add user input validation" not "update")
- Each commit should represent a logical unit of work
- Don't commit broken code to main branch

---

### Criterion 5: Reflection (15%)

*Can you articulate what you learned and what you'd do differently?*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **4 - Exceptional** | Thoughtful, specific reflection demonstrating deep learning. Clearly articulates challenges, solutions, and growth. Identifies concrete improvements for future work. Shows metacognitive awareness. |
| **3 - Proficient** | Solid reflection addressing all prompts. Shows understanding of what was learned. Identifies some areas for improvement. |
| **2 - Developing** | Brief reflection that addresses prompts superficially. Limited insight into learning process. Generic statements about improvement. |
| **1 - Beginning** | Minimal reflection. Doesn't engage meaningfully with prompts. No evidence of learning articulation. |
| **0 - Not Attempted** | Reflection not submitted. |

**Reflection Prompts:**
1. What was the most challenging part of this project? How did you overcome it?
2. What would you do differently if starting over?
3. What CS concepts did this project help you understand better?
4. How did working in [chosen language] affect your approach?
5. What are you most proud of in this project?

### Project Grade Calculation

```
Final Score = (Creativity × 0.25) + (Functionality × 0.25) +
              (Code Quality × 0.20) + (Process × 0.15) + (Reflection × 0.15)

Final Score × 25 = Percentage (0-100)
```

| Final Score | Letter Grade |
|-------------|--------------|
| 3.7 - 4.0 | A |
| 3.3 - 3.69 | A- |
| 3.0 - 3.29 | B+ |
| 2.7 - 2.99 | B |
| 2.3 - 2.69 | B- |
| 2.0 - 2.29 | C+ |
| 1.7 - 1.99 | C |
| 1.3 - 1.69 | C- |
| 1.0 - 1.29 | D |
| Below 1.0 | F |

| Code Quality | | |
| Process & Iteration | | |
| Reflection | | |

**Predicted Grade:** ___

**What I'm most proud of:**

**What I'd improve with more time:**

**Questions for instructor:**

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I resubmit projects for a better grade?**
A: Yes, with instructor approval. You must submit a revision plan first.

**Q: What if my code works but I can't explain it?**
A: Code you can't explain suggests copied code or incomplete understanding. Be prepared to discuss your work.

**Q: How important is creativity vs. functionality?**
A: Both are weighted equally (25% each). A creative but broken project and a working but bland project will both lose points.

**Q: Can I use libraries/frameworks not covered in class?**
A: Yes, with disclosure. Learning to use new tools is valuable! Just cite what you used.

**Q: What counts as "meaningful" git commits?**
A: Commits that show development progress. "Added user input handling" is meaningful. "asdfasdf" is not.
