# CS 101-103: Introduction to Computer Science
## A Project-Based, Multi-Language Journey

**Course Version:** Three-Language Curriculum (Project-Based)
**Prerequisites:** None (designed for new students with no prior programming experience)
**Structure:** Three 11-week quarters
**Credit Hours:** 4 per quarter (12 total)

---

## Course Philosophy

This is a **project-based** course where learning happens through building. There are no traditional exams—your understanding is demonstrated through creative projects that grow in complexity across three quarters.

**We believe:**
- Programming is a creative act, like writing or making music
- The best way to learn is by building things you care about
- Making mistakes and iterating is more valuable than "getting it right" the first time
- Understanding concepts matters more than memorizing syntax

**Computer Science is not any single programming language.** By learning through three languages (Python, C++, Haskell) and exploring four more (Racket, C, Rust, Prolog), you'll develop the adaptable thinking skills that transfer to any language you encounter in the future.

---

## The Three Quarters

| Quarter | Focus | Core Languages | Minor Languages | Major Projects |
|---------|-------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Q1: Foundations** | Building blocks of programming | Python, C++, Haskell (intro) | — | 3 projects |
| **Q2: Paradigms** | Different ways to think about code | All three balanced | Racket, C | 3 projects |
| **Q3: Applications** | Putting it all together | All three advanced | Rust, Prolog | 3 projects + Capstone |

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of all three quarters, you will be able to:

### Creative & Technical Skills
1. **Design and build software** from scratch to solve problems you care about
2. **Write functional programs** in Python, C++, and Haskell
3. **Read and adapt code** in languages you've never seen before
4. **Choose the right tool** for different kinds of problems
5. **Iterate and improve** your work based on feedback and testing

### Conceptual Understanding
6. **Explain core CS concepts** (functions, recursion, data structures, algorithms) without language-specific jargon
7. **Compare paradigms** (procedural, object-oriented, functional, logic) and know when each shines
8. **Analyze algorithm efficiency** using Big-O notation
9. **Understand language design tradeoffs** and why different languages exist

### Professional Practices
10. **Use version control** (Git) to manage your code and collaborate
11. **Write and run tests** to verify your programs work correctly
12. **Debug systematically** when things go wrong
13. **Document and present** your creative work

---

## Assessment: Project-Based Learning

### No Exams!

This course has **no midterms or finals**. Your learning is assessed entirely through:
- **Projects** (75% of grade)
- **Exercises & Labs** (15% of grade)
- **Participation & Reflection** (10% of grade)

### Project Assessment Philosophy

Projects are graded on:

| Criterion | Weight | What We're Looking For |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Creativity & Ambition** | 25% | Did you push yourself? Try something interesting? |
| **Functionality** | 25% | Does it work? Does it do what you set out to do? |
| **Code Quality** | 20% | Is it readable, organized, well-structured? |
| **Process & Iteration** | 15% | Did you use version control? Iterate and improve? |
| **Reflection** | 15% | Can you articulate what you learned and what you'd do differently? |

### Creative Extensions

Every project has a **base requirement** and **creative extensions**. You can:
- **Meet the base requirement** for a B-range grade
- **Add creative extensions** for A-range grades
- **Propose your own extensions** that excite you

We want you to make projects your own!

---

## Grading Scale

| Letter | Percentage | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| A | 93-100% | Exceptional creative work, goes beyond requirements |
| A- | 90-92% | Excellent work with creative extensions |
| B+ | 87-89% | Strong work meeting all requirements |
| B | 83-86% | Solid work with minor gaps |
| B- | 80-82% | Meets basic requirements |
| C+ | 77-79% | Adequate with some incomplete elements |
| C | 73-76% | Minimum acceptable work |
| C- | 70-72% | Marginal pass |
| D | 60-69% | Significant gaps |
| F | <60% | Not passing |
