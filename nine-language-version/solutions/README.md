# Exercise Solutions

This directory contains example solutions for all exercises in the Polyglot Programming course.

## Purpose

These solutions are provided to:
1. **Help instructors** grade assignments and understand expected outcomes
2. **Guide students** who are stuck after making genuine attempts
3. **Show different approaches** across multiple programming languages
4. **Demonstrate idiomatic code** in each language

## Important Guidelines for Students

### Before Looking at Solutions

**Try the exercises yourself first!** The real learning happens when you struggle with a problem and work through it.

**When to look at solutions:**
- ✅ After you've completed an exercise (to compare approaches)
- ✅ After 30+ minutes of being genuinely stuck
- ✅ To see how different languages solve the same problem
- ✅ To learn idioms and best practices

**When NOT to look at solutions:**
- ❌ Before attempting the exercise
- ❌ After only 5 minutes of trying
- ❌ To copy-paste without understanding
- ❌ Instead of reading the lesson material

### How to Use Solutions Effectively

1. **Try first**: Spend at least 20-30 minutes attempting the exercise
2. **Get partially stuck**: Try to solve as much as you can
3. **Look at hints only**: Read the solution overview, not the full code
4. **Implement your version**: Close the solution and implement from memory
5. **Compare approaches**: After finishing, compare your solution to ours
6. **Try another language**: Implement the same exercise in a different language

## Multiple Solutions

Many exercises have multiple valid solutions. Our solutions show:
- **Idiomatic approach**: How an experienced programmer in that language would solve it
- **Alternative approaches**: Different valid ways to solve the problem
- **Comparisons**: How the same problem differs across paradigms

## Language Coverage

Not every exercise has solutions in all 9 languages. We provide:
- Solutions in **3-5 representative languages** for each exercise
- At least one **imperative** (Python, JavaScript, C)
- At least one **functional** (Haskell, Racket)
- Sometimes **systems** (Rust, C) or **logic** (Prolog) where relevant

## For Instructors

### Using Solutions for Grading

**Don't expect exact matches!** Students may:
- Use different algorithms
- Structure code differently
- Choose different language features
- All while being equally correct

**Focus on:**
- Does it work correctly?
- Does it demonstrate understanding of concepts?
- Is it reasonably idiomatic for the language?
- Is it readable?

### Showing Solutions

**Best practices:**
1. Have students submit before showing solutions
2. Show solutions AFTER the due date
3. Discuss multiple approaches in class
4. Encourage students to share their solutions
5. Highlight creative or elegant student solutions

## Contributing

If you find errors or have better solutions, please contribute:
1. Solutions should be **correct** and **tested**
2. Solutions should be **idiomatic** for the language
3. Solutions should be **well-commented** to explain the approach
4. Include **edge cases** where relevant

## Notes

- **Solutions are examples**: Your solution can be different and still correct
- **Simplicity is valued**: Don't over-engineer
- **Comments explain why**: Not just what the code does
- **Multiple paradigms**: See how different approaches work

Remember: The goal is to **learn programming paradigms**, not to memorize specific solutions!
