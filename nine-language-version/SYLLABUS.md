# Introduction to Programming Through Multiple Paradigms

## Course Overview

This course teaches fundamental computer science and programming concepts through exploration of multiple programming languages representing different paradigms. By learning the same concepts in different languages, students gain a deeper understanding of programming principles and develop language-agnostic problem-solving skills.

## Course Philosophy

Rather than learning programming through a single language, this course exposes students to:
- **Procedural Programming** (C, Python)
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (Java, Ruby, Python)
- **Functional Programming** (Haskell, OCaml, Racket)
- **Logic Programming** (Prolog)
- **Multi-Paradigm Languages** (Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Rust)

This polyglot approach helps students:
1. Understand that programming concepts transcend specific languages
2. Recognize patterns and idioms across paradigms
3. Choose appropriate tools for different problems
4. Become adaptable programmers who can learn new languages quickly

## Prerequisites

None. This course is designed for absolute beginners with no prior programming experience.

## Languages Used

| Language | Version | Paradigm(s) | Key Learning Focus |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Python | 3.11+ | Multi-paradigm | Readable syntax, versatility |
| JavaScript | ES6+ | Multi-paradigm | Web development, async |
| C | C11 | Procedural | Memory, low-level concepts |
| Java | 21+ | OOP | Strong typing, enterprise patterns |
| Ruby | 3.3+ | OOP, Functional | Expressiveness, metaprogramming |
| Haskell | GHC 9.4+ | Pure Functional | Type systems, immutability |
| OCaml | 4.14+ | Functional | Type inference, pattern matching |
| Racket | 8.10+ | Functional (Scheme) | Macros, language design |
| Prolog | SWI 9.0+ | Logic | Declarative reasoning |
| Rust | 1.91+ | Systems, Functional | Safety, ownership |
