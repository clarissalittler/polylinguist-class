# Practice Projects

Multi-lesson projects that integrate concepts from across the course.

## Project Overview

These projects are designed to:
- **Apply multiple concepts** from different lessons
- **Compare paradigms** by implementing in multiple languages
- **Build real programs** that do useful things
- **Develop problem-solving skills** across language boundaries

## Project List

## How to Use These Projects

### For Students

1. **Choose a project** at your level
2. **Read the specification** carefully
3. **Plan your approach** before coding
4. **Implement in 2-3 languages** from different paradigms
5. **Compare your implementations** - what was easier/harder in each?
6. **Reflect** on what you learned

### For Instructors

- Assign as **milestones** after completing relevant lessons
- Use for **assessment** (see grading rubrics)
- Encourage **language comparison** in write-ups
- Support **pair programming** or team projects
- Showcase **exemplary work** (with permission)

## Grading Suggestions

See `instructor-resources/grading-rubrics.md` for detailed rubrics.

**General Rubric (25 points):**
- Functionality (10 pts): Does it work?
- Multi-language (5 pts): Implemented in 2+ languages?
- Code Quality (5 pts): Clean, readable, idiomatic?
- Documentation (3 pts): README, comments?
- Reflection (2 pts): What did you learn?

## Project Extensions

Each project includes **extensions** for students who want to go deeper:
- Additional features
- Performance optimizations
- More languages
- Real-world applications

## Learning Outcomes

By completing these projects, students will:
- ✅ Apply concepts from multiple lessons
- ✅ Make paradigm-based design decisions
- ✅ Write substantial programs (100+ lines)
- ✅ Debug across multiple languages
- ✅ Compare and contrast approaches
- ✅ Build portfolio-worthy projects
